My research goal is to contribute to our understanding of the elusive questions lying at the intersection of physics, neuroscience, and philosophy: how do robust, adaptive representations of the world emerge from the collective dynamics of ensembles of interconnected neurons? How can we rigorously explain the emergence of high-level semantic structures from low-level syntaxes? Specifially, I am interested in eluciating fundamental computational principles of neural circuits with quantitative tools from dynamical systems, machine learning, and statistics. 

I am a Chinese citizen and an American permanent resident, born and raised in Beijing. When I am not doing research in theoretical neuroscience, I enjoy camping and hiking in beatiful mountainous areas, practicing Ballet, and reading on philosphy.
