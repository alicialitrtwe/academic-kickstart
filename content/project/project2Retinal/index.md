This ongoing project involves analyzing multi-electrode array recordings of retinal responses. Specifically, Iâ€™m interested in using flexible poisson models to discern how variance reflects uncertainty in stimulus perception. This analysis aims to unveil neural computations that cannot be understood from measures of average firing rate alone.
